##Lines - Open Source Edge Detection

>Lines is a simple edge detection software which analyzes an image
>and detects edges, which it displays as black pixels in the second 
>image slot.

###Things I want to do

-   Improve efficiency (currently the output is low res to speed up analyze)
-   Allow for saving of output image
-   Create universal edge detection
